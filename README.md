## Overview

React-Formik-UI is a simple component library, composed out of pure HTML form elements like:
form, input, select, checkbox, radio and textarea.

The Idea behind React-Formik-UI is to make the composition of forms with React and Formik even easier,
so you don't have to write any HTML markup or extra components for your forms.

Each component makes use of Formiks context, there for you need to have Formik installed in your project.

## NEW in v5:

**Typescript:** React-Formik-UI is now written in Typescript

There where several breaking changes, if you come from version 4 please refer to `Migrating from v4 to v5` section in this document for all the changes

## Markup, Styling and ClassNames

The markup for the components Input, PhoneInput, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Textarea, Datepicker and DropZone consists of a wrapper div, label, the main component, hint, and error message.

By default all component have NO styling applied at all.</br>
This is intentionally, so you have the possibility to apply your own styling through css or scss by passing a custom className.</br>
All the components used in the Form are scoped by the default classes, situated on the Form component, `react-formik-ui form-wrapper`

Each component has its corresponding component class (eg: PhoneInput component  `phoneInput` ) followed a level deeper by its wrapper class (eg: phoneInput component  `phoneInput-wrapper` ), as well as the class `form-element`.</br>

You can pass the `style` prop on each component, to add custom inline styles to the component main element. Lets say you ad a style object through the style prop on the Select component, the inline styles will be applied to the select element of the Select component.

The `className` Prop can be passed on each component to add a css class directly to the component instead of the wrapper div, so libraries like Bootstrap can be used to style the form component.

**The Styling prop:** If you pass the `styling` prop to the `Form` component with `structure` as value, a minimal styling will be applied to add some structure to each `form-element`.

In case you pass the value `theme` through the `styling` prop on the `Form` component, the React-Formik-Ui Theme will be applied

## Migrating from v4 to v5:

- `Button` component has been removed, therfore you should use your own.
- `SubmitBtn` component now also recieves a `text` prop for rnedering the text of the button
- `mode` prop has been renamed to `styling`, the values `structured` and `themed` for the it also have been renamed to `structure` and `theme`.
- Datepicker component has been renamed to `DatePicker``
- The `style` prop has been removed form the `DatePicker` and `PhoneInput`component

So make shure to have those packages installed to your project to make use of React-Formik-UI.</br>
